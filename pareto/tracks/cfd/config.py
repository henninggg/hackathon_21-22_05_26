# --- Domain ---
N = 32          # interior grid points per side (total grid is (N+2)×(N+2))
L = 1.0         # domain side length [m]

# --- Fluid properties ---
NU  = 0.01      # kinematic viscosity [m²/s]
RHO = 1.0       # density [kg/m³]

# --- Boundary condition ---
U_LID = 1.0     # lid (top wall) velocity in x-direction [m/s]
                # => Reynolds number Re = U_LID * L / NU = 100 (Stokes regime)

# --- Time stepping ---
# Von Neumann stability for 2D explicit diffusion: dt < dx² / (4·ν)
# We use DT_SAFETY × that bound as a conservative factor.
DT_SAFETY = 0.25    # safety factor (50 % of the theoretical 2D limit)

# --- Step A: Laplacian stencil order ---
# k = stencil half-width; accuracy = O(h^{2k})
#   k=1 →  3-point  O(h²)   [default, cheapest]
#   k=2 →  5-point  O(h⁴)
#   k=3 →  7-point  O(h⁶)

# --- Solver (Step B) ---

CG_TOL          = 1e-6      # CG residual convergence tolerance

# --- Run control ---
N_STEPS     = 100   # maximum number of time steps
DIV_TOL     = 1e-6  # steady-state velocity divergence tolerance (early stop)
PRINT_EVERY = 50    # print diagnostics every this many steps
